# MRI_RTDoc_flow
Script to produce a High_frequency_MRI_database_Supplementary like from Tractometry flow outputs specifically.
Code WIP. No tests, and no robustness available yet. There is no guarantee of good results.
All parameters and options are optimized for Tractometry flow with a certain version of nextflow scilpy.
